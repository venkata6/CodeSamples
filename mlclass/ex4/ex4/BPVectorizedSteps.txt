Here I provide my algorithm of BP in vectorized form:

1 - Let's training samples (x1,y1),...,(xm,ym)

2- Set activation of first layer as a1=x

3- Compute activation of al, for l=2,...,L-1,L

4- Compute δL=aL−y.

5- Compute δl=(Θl)Tδl+1.∗al.∗(1−al), for l=L-1,L-2,...,3,2

6- Set Δl:=δl+1(al)T

7- Set Dl:=1mΔl for bias terms.

8- Set Dl:=1mΔl+λmΘl for all terms except bias terms
